# darkness

`darkness`, an open Dark Engine(tm), is a substantial rewrite of the openDarkEngine project, and aims to be an extensible, cross platform implementation of the [Dark Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Engine). It aims to support all previously-generated official and fan content, and admit modular access to modernizing the graphics and AI stacks.
